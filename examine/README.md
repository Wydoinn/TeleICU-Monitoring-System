# Examine Train Results

After training YOLOv10 for object and motion detection models, the runs folder is where the output and logs from the training and validation process are stored. Using the training and validation results showed numerous plots and validation findings. The following are the outcomes that are examined.

- Train Results
- Confusion Matrix
- Comfusion Matrix Normalized
- F1 Curve
- Precision-Confidence Curve
- Recall-Confidence Curve
- Precision-Recall Curve
- validation Batch Results
