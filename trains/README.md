# Train Notebooks

The object and motion detection datasets were trained using a YOLOv10 model. There are multiple train notebooks. Both variants used the YOLOv10 models listed below.

## Object Detection Train
- YOLOv10 Nano Model
- YOLOv10 Small Model
- YOLOv10 Medium Model
- YOLOv10 Large Model
- YOLOv10 Small Model with Data Augmentation

## Motion Detection Train
- YOLOv10 Nano Model
- YOLOv10 Small Model
- YOLOv10 Medium Model
- YOLOv10 Large Model
- YOLOv10 Small Model with Data Augmentation
