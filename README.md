# TeleICU Monitoring System üñ•Ô∏èüé¶

- TeleICU empowers intensivists, the backbone of ICUs, to manage more patients.  This remote monitoring system leverages AI:
  - YOLOv10: This powerful deep learning model identifies patients and tracks vitals in real-time video feeds.
  - Deep SORT: It builds on YOLOv10's work, tracking patient movements to create a detailed health picture.
  
- With AI handling the heavy lifting, a single intensivist can:
  - Monitor multiple patients simultaneously, freeing up time for deeper care.
  - Intervene faster thanks to real-time monitoring, potentially improving patient outcomes.
  
TeleICU with AI is revolutionizing critical care by boosting efficiency and effectiveness.
