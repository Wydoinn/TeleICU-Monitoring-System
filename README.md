      <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Innovative Monitoring System for TeleICU Patients Using Video Processing and Deep Learning.<br><br>
      <strong>Description:</strong> TeleICU is a concept for monitoring ICU patients from remote locations to reduce the burden of on-site intensivists. Currently, there are multiple products available in this domain where one professional seated at a remote location physically monitors one or two remote patients in a TeleICU. The proposed solution should work to reduce the burden of remote health care professionals so that one remote health care professional can monitor 5 or more patients at a single time.
