# TeleICU Monitoring System üñ•Ô∏èüé¶

- TeleICU empowers intensivists, the backbone of ICUs, to manage more patients.  This remote monitoring system leverages AI:
  - YOLOv10: This powerful deep learning model identifies patients and tracks vitals in real-time video feeds.
  - Deep SORT: It builds on YOLOv10's work, tracking patient movements to create a detailed health picture.
  
- With AI handling the heavy lifting, a single intensivist can:
  - Monitor multiple patients simultaneously, freeing up time for deeper care.
  - Intervene faster thanks to real-time monitoring, potentially improving patient outcomes.
  
TeleICU with AI is revolutionizing critical care by boosting efficiency and effectiveness.

```

**3. Clone YOLOv10 Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10.git
pip install .
```

**4. TeleICU Monitoring System Application**

- For Web Application

```
python app.py
# Please visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 on your browser
```

- For Windows Application

```
python monitor.py
```

## Test

The ```test.py``` is a GUI application for a TeleICU Monitoring System Test built with PyQt5. It utilizes YOLOv10 models for both object and motion detection. Key features include:

- Predicting and displaying detections on images, videos, and webcam feeds.
- Annotating detections with bounding boxes and labels.
- Saving annotated images and videos.
- Providing a user-friendly interface with buttons for different prediction modes.

```
python test.py
```

## Convert

```convert.py``` A simple Tkinter GUI application for exporting a YOLOv10 model to various formats including TorchScript, ONNX, OpenVINO, and TensorRT, with functionality to select the model file and handle GPU availability for TensorRT export.

```
python convert.py
```
