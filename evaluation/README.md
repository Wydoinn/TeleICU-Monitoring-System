# Metrics Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of object detection and motion detection models involves using a variety of metrics to assess different aspects of the model's predictions. Here you will discover evaluation metrics for both object and motion detection models.The following metrics are available.

- P (Precision)
- R (Recall)
- mAP50 (Mean Average Precision at IoU=0.50)
- mAP50-95 (Mean Average Precision at IoU=0.50 to 0.95)
